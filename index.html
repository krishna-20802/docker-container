    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The lion, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," is one of the most iconic and powerful animals in the world. Known for their strength, regal mane, and social behavior, lions have been a symbol of bravery, power, and leadership in various cultures throughout history. Lions are a species of large cats belonging to the genus Panthera, which also includes tigers, leopards, and jaguars.</p>

    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Lions have a muscular build with large heads, broad chests, and strong limbs. Male lions are particularly distinguished by their magnificent mane, which is a symbol of their maturity and dominance. The mane can range in color from golden to dark brown, and it grows thicker as the lion ages. Female lions, on the other hand, do not have a mane and are slightly smaller in size.</p>
    <p>Lions have sharp claws and teeth designed for hunting and defending themselves. Their eyes are large and provide excellent vision, especially during low light conditions. The fur of a lion is short and tawny, helping them blend into their natural habitat.</p>

    <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
    <p>Lions are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population of Asiatic lions located in the Gir Forest of India. They inhabit grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands, areas that provide them with ample space for hunting and territory defense. Lions prefer to live in areas with access to water sources, such as rivers or lakes.</p>

    <h2>Social Structure</h2>
    <p>Lions are unique among big cats because they live in social groups called prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their cubs, and a few male lions. The females do most of the hunting, while the males defend the pride’s territory. Lions are known for their cooperative nature, and the pride works together to ensure the survival of the group.</p>
    <p>The pride's leader is usually the dominant male, and he has the responsibility of protecting the group from intruders. Male lions will often fight other males to establish dominance and take control of a pride. The leader’s role is crucial to the pride’s survival, as he ensures that the females are protected and the territory is defended from rival lions.</p>

    <h2>Diet and Hunting</h2>
    <p>Lions are carnivores and apex predators, meaning they sit at the top of the food chain in their ecosystems. They primarily hunt large herbivores such as antelope, zebras, and buffaloes, using their strength and teamwork to bring down prey. Lions often hunt in groups, with females working together to ambush and overpower their prey.</p>
    <p>Lions can also scavenge from other predators, especially when food is scarce. They are known to steal kills from hyenas, leopards, and cheetahs. However, they prefer to make their own kills, and hunting provides a crucial source of nutrition for the pride.</p>

    <h2>Reproduction and Lifespan</h2>
    <p>The lion’s reproductive cycle is seasonal, with females usually giving birth to litters of 1 to 4 cubs. Cubs are born blind and vulnerable, relying on their mothers for protection and nourishment. They begin to open their eyes at around 10 days old and start walking after about 3 weeks.</p>
    <p>Lions reach sexual maturity at around 2 to 3 years old, but they typically do not start breeding until they are older. The lifespan of a lion in the wild is around 10 to 14 years, although they can live longer in captivity.</p>

    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>While lions were once widespread across Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe, their population has significantly declined over the past century due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poaching, and illegal hunting. Lions are currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, with an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 lions remaining in the wild.</p>
    <p>Efforts to conserve lions include habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and community engagement programs to reduce human-lion conflict. Conservation organizations are working to ensure that lions continue to roam the wild for generations to come.</p>
